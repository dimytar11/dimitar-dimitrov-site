                <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                <p>I'm Dimitar Dimitrov and I'm 30 years old. I started very soon to practice programming and I love it.
                    My purpose is to become a software developer and to start work as soon as positive. That's why I
                    gonna give everything from myself to
                    achieve and realize that.<br>
                    Also, I like to practice different sports as football, cycling, different exercise programs, and of course - adrenaline experiences.</p>
                <p>Personally, I have a great family. Me and my wife Kameliya have two gorgeous daughters - Magdalena(4
                    years old) and Mihaela(2 years old). We love to spend our time together, to have walks in the park,
                    to travel around the country and mostly to have fun.</p>
